            Painting
        </h2>
        <p>I love to paint and express my creativity through different colors and brush strokes. Painting allows me to bring their imagination to life on a canvas, using color, brushwork, and composition to create a visual representation of their thoughts and feelings. </p>

    <h2>Photography</h2>

    <p>I enjoy taking pictures and capturing moments in time that I can cherish forever. For me photography is a powerful tool for capturing and sharing our experiences, memories, and emotions with the world.</p>

     Travelling
    </h2>
    <p> 
      I travel not to escape life, but for life not to escape myself.Traveling can also be a great opportunity to make lasting memories, create new friendships, and build lifelong connections with the people and places you encounter along the way.
